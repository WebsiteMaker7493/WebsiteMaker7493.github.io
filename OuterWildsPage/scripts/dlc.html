        <h1>Outer wilds has a DLC that near perfectly fits in with the base game</h1>
        <h1>The DLC adds one new planet, or in this case, a spaceship for you to explore</h1>
        <h1>This spaceship, named The Stranger, is home to a new alien species to learn about</h1>
        <h1>The new species has no known official name, so the commmunity has named<br> them the Owlks, due to their resemblance to Owls and Elks</h1>
        <h1>The DLC expands on the base game not only by story, but also by gameplay,<br> as it contains horror sequences</h1>
        <h1>The horror sequences dont feel out of place however due to the great atmosphere created</h1>
